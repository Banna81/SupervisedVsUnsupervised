# SupervisedVsUnsupervised
This is a full notebook focused on Classification problems using multiple supervised and unsupervised models
Ihe notebook uses multiple datasets and apply preprocessing, feature scaling and feature selection techniques 
Then goes to apply classification through KNN, SVM , Decision trees, Naive Bayes for supervised models 
And applys K-means and Hirerachal clustering in the Unsupervised models
